###### Understanding Messaging
Messaging is a technique to communicate applications or software components.
JMS is mainly used to send and receive message from one application to another.

###### Requirement of JMS
Generally, user sends message to application. But, if we want to send message from one application to another, we need to use JMS API.
Consider a scenario, one application A is running in INDIA and another application B is running in USA. To send message from A application to B, we need to use JMS.
